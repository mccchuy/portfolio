            <p> ZOOX is a company creating self-driving or autonomous vehicles 
            designed to make personal transportation safer, cleaner, and 
            more enjoyable. The rider simply pays for the service, and the vehicle 
            comes to the user, similar to rideshare services such as Uber or Lyft.
         </p>
         <h2>Prompt</h2>
         <p> The task was to design a conceptual UI for the in-ride experience for ZOOX vehicles.
             The system should be designed to be fully integrated into the vehicle. The user should 
            be able to control anything a driver could typically control in a car. Functionalities include:
            <ul class = "req">
                <li>Welcome the user to the vehicle and have confirmation system for security</li>
                <li>Display trip progress </li>
                <li>Real time CarView</li>
                <li>Contact support</li>
                <li>Interior climate control adjustment</li>
                <li>Different preset climate modes</li>
                <li>Enable destination changes</li>
                <li>Ability to save climate preferences and access them in future ride </li>
            </ul>
         </p>

                <img class = "lf" src = "zoox images/lf2.png">
                <p> The dashboard page is the main page, which displays a panic (!) button
                 that will be present throughout the user experience. The main page is 
                 meant to mimic a typical car dashboard, with key features like 
                 the navigation and speedometer being present.  </p>
                <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> The use of both the spedometer and the MPH reading
                    at the top center are reduntant.</p>

                <p> The navigation page displays key information for the user,
                    such as the date and time, distance until the next turn, estimated 
                    distance remaining, a trip progress bar, and a compass. It also
                    includes several interactive features, such as
                    a "Change Route" button, an expand button, and the ability to expand between
                    three different map views: the standard navigation map, RealView, and CarView.</p>
                <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> The ability to change route is not
                    easily accessible. </p>

                <p> The first climate page displays different ways the user can adjust the 
                    climate settings in their ZOOX vehicle, including temperature, lighting, and
                    preset climate modes for user convenience. It also includes the ability to save 
                    preferred controls. </p>
                <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> Cluttered; too much going on in one page, 
                should be broken up into several pages. Unclear what the star symbol on the left 
                is for </p>

                <p> The second climate page displays the seat controls for the user to adjust, including
                    the ability to activate and control seat warmers, </p>
                    <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> Unclear how to get to this page from the original
